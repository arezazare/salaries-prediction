# ðŸ’¼ Salaries Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee salaries using job-related and employment data. The goal is to develop a regression model that estimates compensation based on features such as job title, department, and employment status.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source**: [San Francisco Salaries Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pileatedperch/sf-salaries-exercise/input)
- **Description**: Contains salary data for San Francisco public employees, including base pay, overtime pay, total benefits, and job details.
- **Size**: ~150,000 records with multiple columns covering job classification, compensation, and employment year.

## ðŸ§ª Key Tasks
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates
- Standardized categorical values and cleaned job titles
- Performed EDA to identify salary trends and outliers
- Feature engineered new columns for employment status and job grouping
- Built regression models to predict salaries

## ðŸ§  Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Evaluation metrics: RÂ² score, MAE, RMSE

## ðŸ”§ Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git / GitHub

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
Achieved strong predictive performance using Random Forest. Identified job title, full-time status, and department as the most influential features for salary prediction.
